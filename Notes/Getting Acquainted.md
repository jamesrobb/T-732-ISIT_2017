* Work [J] 
* Power [P] = work [W] / time 
* [Q] Coulomb 
    * -1C = "Charge" of ~10^-5 electrons
        * ~ 6*10^18 electrons
* 1 Ampere = C / S  (coulomb / seconds)
    * current = charge / time
* Volt [V] = Potential difference [U]
* Electrical power
    * P = 1 * V

* Battery (rechargeable)
    * mAh (charge)
    * 3.7V * 500mAh = 3.7V * 0.5A * 3600s = 6660J

    Ohm's paper says

            l  -> length
    R = p ------
            A  -> 

    Everything that conducts, has an internal resistance

    Ohm's law
          V    -> Voltage
    R = ------
          I    -> Current

    V = RI
    I = V / R


    Kirchoff:
        Current law at any junction:
        ΣI = 
        i i
    Voltage law:
        For every closed circuit
        ΣV = =  
        i i
